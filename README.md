# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
---
#### Final stage of the mobile web specialist certification course, containing work done from stage 1 through to stage 3

This **Restaurant Reviews** project involves all the iterations to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 

### What do I do from here?

1. Clone the repo containing the [development server](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3)
2. Install the development server's dependencies with
  ```
  # npm install
  ```
3. Follow the instructions contained in the [development server](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3)'s README to access the JSON data for the restaurant reviews web application.
4. Launch a web browser to access the [web application](https://calebikhuohon.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/).

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
