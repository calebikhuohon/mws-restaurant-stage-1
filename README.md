# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
---
#### Final stage of the mobile web specialist certification course, containing work done from stage 1 through to stage 3

This **Restaurant Reviews** project involves all the iterations to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 

### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Clone the repo containing the [development server](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3)
4. Install the development server's dependencies with
  ```
  # npm install
  ```
5. Follow the instructions contained in the [development server's](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) to access the JSON data for the restaurant reviews web application.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
